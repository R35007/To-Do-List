# To-Do-List

A simple Tool which helps to track your daily task status. 
You could prioritize your task an also can set the status to open, inprogress and done.
You can also allocate a future task to your list.
A simple dashboard is available to view the today and overall task reports.

This tool is built upon the react js and node js. 
The data are stored as a json file for read and write operation. 
In the upcomming version I will go with firebase to store the data and host this application online so that any one can use.

### Setup Steps :

- Step 1 : **"git clone https://github.com/R35007/To-Do-List.git"**  to clone the repo or you can download as a zip
- Step 2 : go to the project folder in terminal and give **"npm run dev-i"** to install the dependencies.
- Step 3 : once the instalation is complete give **"npm start"** to start the application
- Step 4 : The defalut browser will automatically opens and runs the application, if not go to any browser and give             **"http://localhost:3000/"** to run the application on the browser
